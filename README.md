# Robotics: Project-Based-Learning

Welcome to the "Robotics: Project Based Learning" repository! This open-source project is designed for beginners who want to start learning about robotics. Here, you'll find a collection of tutorials and valuable links to other resources that will guide you through the basics of robotics, step-by-step. Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or just curious, this repository will help you understand the basics and get started with your own robotics projects.

## Contribution
We invite the community to contribute by adding new learning materials and writing tutorials. Your contributions will help make this repository a valuable resource for everyone interested in robotics. Let's learn and create together! Let's learn together!

### Robot? What would you call a "Robot"?
Ever seen a robot in real life? You've at least seen one in movies, right? In movies, robots are usually structured as humans. But is it necessary? Do robots need to look like humans? For example, do you know about floor-cleaning robots, like Roomba? Those DO NOT look like humans at all! They're small, circular-shaped robots that can move into tiny corners. They're made that way because that shape is most convenient for what they do. Also, they're autonomous!

Also, robots need to be able to move around, right? So, can you call an RC car a robot? Of course not! But, it can move, so why not? Because you need to control it! It is not autonomous. So a robot needs to be fully autonomous? Well, it doesn't have to be FULLY autonomous, but there should be some things it can do by itself. Also, usually, a robot has a clear task.

Okay, so as humans, we can do a lot of things. But to do a lot of things, we need to think a lot, right? And what do we use to think about something? We use our brain ðŸ§ . Do robots have brains? They do, but not like ours. Their brains come in lotta shapes and sizes. This repository focuses on a few of them. These brains are not particularly powerful, but they're useful for basic robots that do simple tasks.
